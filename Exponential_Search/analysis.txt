Algorithm Analysis â€“ Binary Search & Exponential Search
--------------------------------------------------------

Language Used: C++
Input Type: N random integers (user-defined)
Environment: Linux(Arch), Intel i3, 12GB RAM

Exponential Search
-----------------------
Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1)
- Average Case: O(log i), where i is the range where the element is found
- Worst Case: O(log N)

Runtime Test Results:
- Input Size: 1000 --> Time: 0.0017 ms
- Input Size: 10000 --> Time: 0.0032 ms

Advantages:
- Works better for large sorted arrays
- Locates range quickly before applying binary search

Conclusion:
- Binary Search is simpler and efficient for small arrays
- Exponential Search is more suitable when search space is huge and sorted
